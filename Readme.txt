V3 major rehaul of my personal website! Given that I do not consider myself to be too much of a web designer by trade, and I wanted to get this up and running
quickly, I decided to use an existing Bootstrap Template as a base and work off of it. There are still a number of personal modifications, and likely to be more
in the near future, but many thanks to BootstrapMade for the DevFolio template.

Base Template Info:

Template Name: DevFolio
Template URL: https://bootstrapmade.com/devfolio-bootstrap-portfolio-html-template/
Author: BootstrapMade.com
License: https://bootstrapmade.com/license/
